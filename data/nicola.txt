Nicola Sturgeon is to quit as Scotland’s first minister in a shock decision. A source confirmed Sturgeon, who has been the country’s longest-serving first minister, will announce her resignation at 11am on Wednesday in Edinburgh. The Scottish National party leader has suffered a series of political setbacks recently, including the UK supreme court defeat of her plans for a fresh independence referendum and a damaging row over a transgender double rapist being sent to a female jail.
